/* 

We use a specific support file for every application but this is needed just to avoid error:

Your project does not contain a default supportFile. We expect a file matching cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} to exist.

If a support file is not necessary for your project, set supportFile to false.
